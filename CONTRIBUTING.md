## Contributing

- The code is written in ES6 using [Javascript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/).
- Please have PRs be single-purpose and try to stick to the coding style that the plugin uses.
- Keep new features easily testable.
- Documentation PRs are more than welcome!
- I'm always looking for people to help maintain this package, if you want to get involved shoot me an email at [anton@lukichev.pro](mailto:anton@lukichev.pro)!
